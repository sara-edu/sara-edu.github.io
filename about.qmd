## Who we are

Dr. Ajay Koli and Dr. Kiran Koli founded the Sara Education Trust (Registered). On 5 April 2023, they started Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science (SARA Institute). SARA offers completely free education for all students. We teach data science, computer skills, English language, and research methodologies.

Before starting SARA, both Ajay and Kiran were full-time Assistant Professor in different private universities. Now, they run SARA Institute only. Currently, they live in Sonipat in a rented house. Recently, they also became parents of a beautiful daughter. They are very thankful to the Ambedkar Educational Society, Sonipat for giving permission to conduct the SARA classes in the Ambedkar Bhawan, Sonipat.
