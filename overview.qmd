# [About us]{.theme-blue}

We are a non-governmental charitable education and research institute founded in April 2023 by Dr. Ajay Koli and Dr. Kiran Koli. Our aim is to take data science education to underrepresented students in India. We offer free of cost data science, computer skills, research and English language courses. Our courses help students to:

1. land a job in the field of data science, and

1. get a fellowship for higher education.
